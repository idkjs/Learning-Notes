## Embrace Constraints

* NOT NULL
* CREATE UNIQUE INDEX

## Performance

Most single queries should be aiming for around a 1ms query time.

## UUID

## Tuning

* If you need more than 500 connections, use PGBouncer.

* Good for implementing queue?

## pg_tune

## Incidents to learn

## Materialized Views

* [Speed up with Materialized Views on PostgreSQL and Rails](https://www.sitepoint.com/speed-up-with-materialized-views-on-postgresql-and-rails/)

## Window Functions

* [Modeling Postgres Common Table Expressions and Window Functions with Rails and ActiveRecord](http://blog.nrowegt.com/modeling-postgres-common-table-expressions-and-window-functions-with-rails-and-activerecord/)

The strength of window functions is not pagination, but analytical calculation.

## Partition

* [pg_partman](https://github.com/keithf4/pg_partman)
* [partitionable](https://github.com/pacuna/partitionable)

## Date

```sql
AVG(sale.price) as average_price,
MAX(sale.price) as max_price,
MIN(sale.price) as min_price,
ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM sale.completed_at) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM sale.created_at))) as average_sale_time
```

## Array

* [Postgres, the Good Parts: Arrays](http://blog.ryankelly.us/2016/08/21/postgres-the-good-parts-arrays.html)

## JSON

## Range

## Pagination

> offset pagination is broken and there are other ways to paginate

## PL/V8

* [JavaScript in your Postgres](https://blog.heroku.com/javascript_in_your_postgres)

## Backup

* pg_dump is good for logical backup with less than 100GB of data
* Once you reached data that can't fit into RAM, you need to use physical backup like [WAL-E](https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e)
