# Postgres

> It's preferable to exercise Postgres's ability to execute JOINs rather than play with your network latency.

RDBMS traditionally feature strong consistency and high availability at the expense of partition tolerance. They are optimized for writes.

NoSQL are optimized for reads with eventual consistency in mind. For MailLog/audit log/activity feed purposes, if we just write once and read many times, then choosing NoSQL is the correct approach.

```
How many relationships are in your data? 
What is the level of complexity in your data? 
How often do the data change? 
How often does your application query the data? 
How often does your application query the relationship underlying the data?
How often do your users update the data? 
How often do your users update the logic in the data?
How critical is your Application in a disaster scenario?
```

## Window Functions

Useful for doing "running aggregate/total".

See https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bruce+momjian+window+functions

Unlike aggregate function like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, which operate on an entire table, Window Functions operate on a set of rows and return a single aggregated value for each row.

The rows retain their separate identities and the aggregated value is merely added to each row rather than grouped together.

* [Folding Postgres Window Functions into Rails](https://blog.codeship.com/folding-postgres-window-functions-into-rails/)
* [Modeling Postgres Common Table Expressions and Window Functions with Rails and ActiveRecord](http://blog.nrowegt.com/modeling-postgres-common-table-expressions-and-window-functions-with-rails-and-activerecord/)
* [Advanced SQL - window functions](http://mjk.space/advanced-sql-window-functions/)
* ANSI/ISO Standard SQL:2003
* ANSI/ISO Standard SQL:2008
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 implemented (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, NTILE and DENSE_RANK functions only)
* SQL Server 2012 implemented the full range of functions finally
* MariaDB 10.2.0 implemented Window Functions finally
* MySQL 8 implemented Window Functions finally

The strength of window functions is not pagination, but **analytical calculation**.

The set of rows used for the calculation is called the "window" and will the entire dataset by default.

The `PARTITION BY` is employed to reduce the window to a particular group within the dataset.

## Partition

* [pg_partman](https://github.com/keithf4/pg_partman)
* [partitionable](https://github.com/pacuna/partitionable)
* [Video: RailsConf 2019 - Postgres & Rails 6 Multi-DB: Pitfalls, Patterns, Performance by Gabe Enslein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4OBp6edNaM)

Default in Postgresql 11

```
ALTER TABLE invoices ATTACH PARTITION invoices_y2018m07 FOR VALUES FROM
('2018-07-01') TO ('2018-08-01');
```

## Range Type or Temporal Extension

Using "contains @>".

"How many movies did we rented out on June 21st?"

```sql
select count(*) from rental
where rental_period @> '2019-06-21'::timestamp;
```

Using "within &&"

"How many movies did we rent during the month of June?"

```sql
select count(*) from rental
where rental_period && tsrange('2019-06-01'::timestamp, '2019-06-30'::timestamp);
```

AND
        ('2016-12-21 23:59:59.999'::timestamp AT TIME ZONE u.timezone)
```

```sql
AVG(sale.price) as average_price,
MAX(sale.price) as max_price,
MIN(sale.price) as min_price,
ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM sale.completed_at) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM sale.created_at))) as average_sale_time
```

## Array

* [Postgres, the Good Parts: Arrays](http://blog.ryankelly.us/2016/08/21/postgres-the-good-parts-arrays.html)

## JSONB

* 12 operators and 23 functions (as of 9.5)
* 2 different indexing methods
* Good for storing, but need to be replaced entirely for updates
* [How to convert json string to text?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27215216/postgres-how-to-convert-json-string-to-text/31757242#31757242)

## Range

* tstzrange

```sql
CREATE TABLE billings (
  formation_id    uuid      NOT NULL,
  validity_period tstzrange NOT NULL,
  price_per_month integer   NOT NULL
);

# Exclusion constraints
ALTER TABLE ONLY billings
ADD CONSTRAINT billings_excl
EXCLUDE USING gist (
  uuid_send(formation_id) WITH =,
  validity_period WITH &&
)
```

## ENUM

* Good for small unchanging constants like AWS regions

## Backup

* pg_dump is good for logical backup with less than 100GB of data
* Once you reached data that can't fit into RAM, you need to use physical backup like [WAL-E](https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e)
