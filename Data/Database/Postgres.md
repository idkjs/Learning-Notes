**BRIN**

```sql
--- table with 100M rows
CREATE TABLE test_bitmap AS
  SELECT mod(i, 100.000) AS val
    FROM generate_series(1, 100.000.000) s(i);
CREATE INDEX test_btree_idx ON test_bitmap(val);
CREATE INDEX test_brin_idx ON test_bitmap USING brin(val);
```

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "btree_gist";
CREATE INDEX ON dynos USING GiST (
  instance_id, tstzrange(started_at, stopped_at, '[]')
)
CREATE INDEX ON dynos (started_at)
CREATE INDEX ON dynos (stopped_at)

SELECT instance_id, started_at, stopped_at
FROM dynos
WHERE instance_id=453345
AND tstzrange(started_at, stopped_at, '[]') @> '2017-05-08 00:57:41'::timestamptz;
```

* CREATE UNIQUE INDEX
* Use check constraints with PLV8??

## Performance

Most single queries should be aiming for around a 1ms query time.

## UUID

* [A Brief History of the UUID](https://segment.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-uuid/)

## Tuning

* If you need more than 500 connections, use PGBouncer.

## EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE

* [PostgreSQL's LATERAL JOIN](https://medium.com/kkempin/postgresqls-lateral-join-bfd6bd0199df)

## SKIP LOCKED

* [PG Casts - The Skip Locked feature in Postgres 9.5](https://www.pgcasts.com/episodes/7/skip-locked/)
* Good for implementing queue?

## pg_tune

## Incidents to learn

* [Gitlab DB incident](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/)

## Materialized/SQL Views

* [Speed up with Materialized Views on PostgreSQL and Rails](https://www.sitepoint.com/speed-up-with-materialized-views-on-postgresql-and-rails/)
* Essentially a caching system at the database
* Virtual table
* Providing roll-ups

## Window Functions

Unlike aggregate function like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, which operate on an entire table, Window Functions operate on a set of rows and return a single aggregated value for each row.

The rows retain their separate identities and the aggregated value is merely added to each row rather than grouped together.

* [Folding Postgres Window Functions into Rails](https://blog.codeship.com/folding-postgres-window-functions-into-rails/)
* [Modeling Postgres Common Table Expressions and Window Functions with Rails and ActiveRecord](http://blog.nrowegt.com/modeling-postgres-common-table-expressions-and-window-functions-with-rails-and-activerecord/)
* [Advanced SQL - window functions](http://mjk.space/advanced-sql-window-functions/)
* ANSI/ISO Standard SQL:2003
* ANSI/ISO Standard SQL:2008
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 implemented (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, NTILE and DENSE_RANK functions only)
* SQL Server 2012 implemented the full range of functions finally
* MariaDB 10.2.0 implemented Window Functions finally
* MySQL 8 implemented Window Functions finally

The strength of window functions is not pagination, but **analytical calculation**.

The set of rows used for the calculation is called the "window" and will the entire dataset by default.

The `PARTITION BY` is employed to reduce the window to a particular group within the dataset.

* [Better Date Manipulation in PostgreSQL Queries](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/better-date-manipulation-in-postgres-queries)

```sql
WHERE inserted_at
BETWEEN ('2016-12-21 00:00:00.000'::timestamp AT TIME ZONE u.timezone)
AND
        ('2016-12-21 23:59:59.999'::timestamp AT TIME ZONE u.timezone)
```

```sql
AVG(sale.price) as average_price,
MAX(sale.price) as max_price,
MIN(sale.price) as min_price,
ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM sale.completed_at) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM sale.created_at))) as average_sale_time
```

## Array

* [Postgres, the Good Parts: Arrays](http://blog.ryankelly.us/2016/08/21/postgres-the-good-parts-arrays.html)

## JSONB

* 12 operators and 23 functions (as of 9.5)
* 2 different indexing methods
* Good for storing, but need to be replaced entirely for updates
* [How to convert json string to text?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27215216/postgres-how-to-convert-json-string-to-text/31757242#31757242)

## Range

* tstzrange

```sql
CREATE TABLE billings (
  formation_id    uuid      NOT NULL,
  validity_period tstzrange NOT NULL,
  price_per_month integer   NOT NULL
);

# Exclusion constraints
ALTER TABLE ONLY billings
ADD CONSTRAINT billings_excl
EXCLUDE USING gist (
  uuid_send(formation_id) WITH =,
  validity_period WITH &&
)
```

## ENUM

* Good for small unchanging constants like AWS regions

## Pagination - OFFSET vs Cursor/Keyset

> offset pagination is broken and there are other ways to paginate

## PL/V8

* [JavaScript in your Postgres](https://blog.heroku.com/javascript_in_your_postgres)

## RAM

## Parallel Query

* 9.6 has Parallel Sequential Scan
* Parallel aggregate and parallel join

## Full-Text Search

* [Implementing Multi-Table Full Text Search with Postgres in Rails](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/implementing-multi-table-full-text-search-with-postgres)

## Backup

* pg_dump is good for logical backup with less than 100GB of data
* Once you reached data that can't fit into RAM, you need to use physical backup like [WAL-E](https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e)
* [3 Methods of backing up Postgres](https://www.urbackup.org/backup_postgresql.html)
