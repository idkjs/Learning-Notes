## Statistics

Statistical significant

### Averages

## Distribution

Because response time can vary a lot with every different tries, we therefore need to think of it not as a single number, but as a **distribution** of values that you can measure.

## Frequency Tables

* Have exact counts, thus we can create a histogram out of it
* With Frequency Tables, you can add the frequencies in each bin. With histogram, you don't always know the exact frequencies.

## Histograms

Better than frequency tables on visualizing the shape of distribution.

* Lets you visually see the shape of a distribution
* Positively Skewed
* Negatively Skewed

## Percentile

Averages are bad for understanding distribution.
