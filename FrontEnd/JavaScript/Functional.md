# Functional JavaScript

In functional programs, we should use functions over values wherever possible:

```js
const oneSecond = () => 1000
const getCurrentTime = () => new Date()
const clear = () => console.clear()
```

> Functions are treated no differently than data. Function is data.

2 models of computations:

1. Alonzo Church - Lambda calculus is a universal model of computation based on function composition.
2. Alan Turing - Turing machine is a universal model of computation that defines a theoretical device that manipulate symbols on a strip of tape.

```js
// Functions can be anonymous
add(x, y) => x + y
(x, y) => x + y

// Function in Î» only accept a single input. They are unary.
// If you need more than one parameter, use currying
(x, y) => x + y

// Becomes
x => y => x + y

// Composition
f . g

compose2 = f => g => x => f(g(x))
```

## Higher-Order Functions

```js
var createScream = function(logger) {
  return function(message) {
    logger(message.toUpperCase() + '!!!')
  }
}

const scream = createScream(message => console.log(message))

scream('functions can be returned from other functions')

// Or using arrow functions
const createScream = logger => message =>
  logger(message.toUpperCase() + '!!!')
```

More than one arrow means that we have a higher-order function.

## Currying

Currying is a functional technique that involves the use of higher-order functions. Currying is the practice of holding on to some of the values needed to complete an operation until the rest can be supplied at a later point in time. This is achieved through the use of a function that returns another function, the curried function.

```js
// Here userLogs is a higher-order function.
const userLogs = userName => message =>
  console.log(`${userName} -> ${message}`)
  
// The log function is produced from userLogs and thus was curried.
const log = userLogs('mech')

log('attempted to load')
```

## Functor

A functor is something that can be mapped over. It's a container that is "mappable".

Array and Promises are functors. Interesting `.then()` obeys the functor laws.
