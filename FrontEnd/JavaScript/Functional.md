# Functional JavaScript

2 models of computations:

1. Alonzo Church - Lambda calculus is a universal model of computation based on function composition.
2. Alan Turing - Turing machine is a universal model of computation that defines a theoretical device that manipulate symbols on a strip of tape.

```js
// Functions can be anonymous
add(x, y) => x + y
(x, y) => x + y

// Function in Î» only accept a single input. They are unary.
// If you need more than one parameter, use currying
(x, y) => x + y

// Becomes
x => y => x + y

// Composition
f . g

compose2 = f => g => x => f(g(x))
