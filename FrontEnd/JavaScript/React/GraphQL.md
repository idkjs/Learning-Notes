## What's Wrong with REST

* Fetching complicated object graphs (i.e. associations) get unwieldy quick
* REST's reliance on URL forces the use of incongruent query params to dynamically interact with resources
* Alternative is to keep resources simple and force multiple HTTP requests which lead to poor performance and over-fetching
* Weak-typing means little way of machine-readable metadata

## Thinking in Graphs

* **Hierarchical** - Most product development involves the creation and manipulation of view hierarchies. To achieve congruence with the structure of these applications, a GraphQL query itself is a hierarchical set of fields. The query is shaped just like the data it returns. It is natural way for product engineers to describe data requirements.
