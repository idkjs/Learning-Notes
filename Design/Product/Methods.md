# Methods

## Personas

* [Personas, you don't need them](https://hondo.wtf/posts/on-personas/)

> Personas create a false barrier between stakeholders and real world customers. This causes unnecessary revisions and wheel spinning.

## Prototype

* [Design by prototyping](https://rgabydesign.com/design-by-prototyping-744b4031e7c7)

> No Prototype, No Meeting

They were trying to think of a (brilliant) idea instead of *building their way* to lots of (generative) ideas.

> Trying, building, learning

## Contextual Research

* In-depth interviews

## Story telling

* You can break it down into features later. Always tell the story first. Scope out the engineering works later. What the person is going through and identify with that first. Sell the story, frame the story.
* Just a few story to implant a seed on their mind, then backup sentiment with data.
