## Mental Models

* Achieve disruption in the marketplace through mental model innovation

## Boredom-Driven Design

* [Embracing the idle mind](https://uxdesign.cc/embracing-the-idle-mind-43067637395c)

> Daydreaming experience made me question how I had been using my idle time so far. Like many others, I was armed to the teeth with e-books, podcasts and social media accounts, ready to kill even the shortest downtime.
> 
> Suddenly, commutes started to become rewarding thinking sessions helping me to process my day and prepare for upcoming ones. Also, my 30-minute ride brought up long forgotten memories and new ideas started coming to me a lot easier.

## Personas

* [Personas, you don't need them](https://hondo.wtf/posts/on-personas/)

> Personas create a false barrier between stakeholders and real world customers. This causes unnecessary revisions and wheel spinning.

> No Prototype, No Meeting

They were trying to think of a (brilliant) idea instead of *building their way* to lots of (generative) ideas.

Prototyping is a habit. It is a way to validate assumptions and ideas.

> Trying, building, learning

---

> Prototyping supports you in making informed decisions in iterative workflows. It allows you to explore the characteristics of materials, quickly combine them into new constellations, and come up with something original. In this way, prototyping actively supports the **generative** and **constructive** nature of design. 
> 
> It lets you validate your assumptions and test ideas and new solution approaches early and in different contexts so that you know what will work and what you are building. Prototyping is a tool and a process, a way of working. But most importantly, prototyping is a way of thinking, a **mindset**.


## Contextual Research

* In-depth interviews

## Story telling

* You can break it down into features later. Always tell the story first. Scope out the engineering works later. What the person is going through and identify with that first. Sell the story, frame the story.
* Just a few story to implant a seed on their mind, then backup sentiment with data.

## User Flow

* [The biggest WTF in design right now](https://uxdesign.cc/the-biggest-wtf-in-design-right-now-87139f367d66)
* User flow should go in one direction
* User flow is not sitemaps or high-res prototypes
* User flow tell story
