## Advice

* Up-front user research is a form of Product Procrastination. It's busy-work. **Even though it was nice to "have the user in mind", the useful data came from the first user tests, not the research.**
* Make an ugly version where all the things work
* It needs to look like crap in order for it to move forward - the art of iteration
* Make a gorgeous version that doesn't do anything
* Store all of it
* Hold the designer accountable
* Reduce risk through compartmentalization
* To finish a project you must know what done looks like

* At some point, even David Allen himself still has to convince himself to do hard things when he doesn't want to. Effort must be expended. This cannot be avoided.
* Software is like makeup in that way: you only notice it when it's messed up. "More interface" does not fix "bad interface". It amplifies it. - [Is Your Software Wearing Too Much Makeup?](https://ux.useronboard.com/is-your-software-wearing-too-much-makeup-a5f1e26f1057#.jyjira8fa)
* Not being too precious about what got us here. I learned the lesson from watching other companies who held onto things too long. Morph every couple of years into something new.

## Metaphors

Product design is all about metaphors. Every icon, every button, and every interaction is a metaphor for something in the physical world. The Dropbox icon is a metaphor for a storage box. Click-and-drag is a metaphor for picking things up with your hand.

But some metaphors mean different things in different cultures. In United States, an owl represents wisdom. In Finland and India, an owl can represent foolishness.
