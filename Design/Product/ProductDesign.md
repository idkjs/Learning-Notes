* At some point, even David Allen himself still has to convince himself to do hard things when he doesn't want to. Effort must be expended. This cannot be avoided.

## Metaphors

Product design is all about metaphors. Every icon, every button, and every interaction is a metaphor for something in the physical world. The Dropbox icon is a metaphor for a storage box. Click-and-drag is a metaphor for picking things up with your hand.

But some metaphors mean different things in different cultures. In United States, an owl represents wisdom. In Finland and India, an owl can represent foolishness.
