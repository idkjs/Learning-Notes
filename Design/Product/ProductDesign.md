## Advice

* Up-front user research is a form of Product Procrastination. It's busy-work. **Even though it was nice to "have the user in mind", the useful data came from the first user tests, not the research.**
* Make an ugly version where all the things work
* It needs to look like crap in order for it to move forward - the art of iteration
* Make a gorgeous version that doesn't do anything
* Store all of it
* Hold the designer accountable
* Reduce risk through compartmentalization
* To finish a project you must know what done looks like
* [Productivity is overrated](http://calnewport.com/blog/2007/08/31/dangerous-ideas-productivity-is-overrated/)
* At some point, even David Allen himself still has to convince himself to do hard things when he doesn't want to. Effort must be expended. This cannot be avoided.
* Software is like makeup in that way: you only notice it when it's messed up. "More interface" does not fix "bad interface". It amplifies it. - [Is Your Software Wearing Too Much Makeup?](https://ux.useronboard.com/is-your-software-wearing-too-much-makeup-a5f1e26f1057#.jyjira8fa)
* Not being too precious about what got us here. I learned the lesson from watching other companies who held onto things too long. Morph every couple of years into something new.

## Microinteraction

* Focusing on tiny moment - Features vs Microinteraction
* Manual Triggers spring from explicit user wants or needs.
* Signature moment
* Bring the data forward - people has some interest in it. See Chrome's download count and progress circle.
* Don't start from zero. Get data from your existing customer. Watch my past behavior.
* Rules tell you what you can or cannot do.

## Design Sprint

* Sprints can create habits in your company. After the first sprint, you might notice a shift in the way your team works. You'll look for ways to turn discussions into testable hypotheses.
* You'll look for ways to answer big questions, not someday, but this week.
* Taken the sprint process and used it on their own to solve problems, reduce risk, and make better decisions at work.

## Design Thinking

## Service Design

> Shifting from products to services requires not only a new mindset and methods, but also new organizational structures. Whereas in a product based organization, teams are organized around each product and organically piece together the customer experience of company offerings, in a services-based organization, teams are organized in alignment with the end-to-end customer experience of the service, with each 'product' as a touchpoint along that journey

## Metaphors

Product design is all about metaphors. Every icon, every button, and every interaction is a metaphor for something in the physical world. The Dropbox icon is a metaphor for a storage box. Click-and-drag is a metaphor for picking things up with your hand.

But some metaphors mean different things in different cultures. In United States, an owl represents wisdom. In Finland and India, an owl can represent foolishness.
