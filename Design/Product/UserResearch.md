# User Research

* Learn what users are really doing by observing them
* Gaining user data to inform your design and product decisions
* Without research, we have no data and no insight and people fall back on assumptions - the enemy of good design
* Without research, we make decisions for ourselves instead of for the user
* There is no excuse for designing based off assumptions

If you can't run interviews, observing users and collecting data, what can you do to at least do some research?

Well, we can ask lots of questions to begin with. Questions are the perfect frame for a research topic. If we plan our research as a series of questions, we can keep our time much more focused.

Some examples of research questions might include:

* How do people navigate the site?
* How easily do people understand what the site is about?
* What do people do after purchasing a product?

Strategy usually begins in the "discovery phase". This is when teams dig deep into research to reveal key information about the product they want to build.
