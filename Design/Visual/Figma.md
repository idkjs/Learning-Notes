## Steps

See https://blog.prototypr.io/how-to-streamline-your-ui-ux-workflow-with-figma-b72c30596435

1. Design your screen in paper
2. Before drawing your screen digitally, create a UI Library Frame (Artboard). This is where all your reusable UI components and guidelines will be.
3. Create Text Styles first.
4. Then Input, Dropdown, Button, Cards, NavBar, Label, Footer, etc.
5. Wireframe it
5. Style your Design System
6. Show stakeholder the UI Library Frame to get feedback on the mood and design style.

## Frames

* Artboard in Sketch
* Nested frames allow for complex design systems
* Nesting frames is the last piece of the puzzle that gives you full control over the alignment of your design as a whole.
* Using multiple frames for the same design also allows you to set up different layout grids for different parts of your design.
