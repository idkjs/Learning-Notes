Stream all your Docker logs to a centralized logging service. Never write to a log file always to stdout. If you have to write to a log file, you're violating several rules and will have to script around it so that long running containers do not run out of disk space. Treat logs as event stream.

**Data acquisition and forwarding to a centralized log store**

## Syslog

**Mac OS-X: syslogd and aslmanager**

```
▶ cat /etc/syslog.conf
▶ cat /etc/asl.conf

# Rules for /var/log/system.log
> system.log mode=0640 format=bsd rotate=seq compress file_max=5M all_max=50M
```

* [**Syslog logging driver for Docker**](http://www.wolfe.id.au/2015/05/03/syslog-logging-driver-for-docker/)

```
▶ dmesg | grep something | less
▶ tail -n 10 -f /var/log/syslog
```

## Docker Logging Solution

If you're running a process on a box, you might expect the output to go to a local log file, or you might expect the output to simply be logged to the kernel buffer where it can be read from `dmesg`. Because of container's restrictions, neither of these will work without some gyrations to do so.

By default, log is sent to `stdout` or `stderr` in the container by Docker daemon and stream into a configurable backend. This backend resides at `/var/lib/docker/containers/:container_id`

```
▶ docker logs -f container_id

// Turn off logging by
--log-driver=none
```

While Docker automatically captures logs for you, it does not also rotate them. YOU NEED TO FIND YOUR LOG STREAMING SOLUTION!

Best practice is to send your container logs to syslog with `--log-driver=syslog`. Docker will now write to `/dev/log` which will be read by the syslog daemon. You also cannot use `docker logs` anymore as there is no more JSON log file to view.

```
▶ docker run -d -p 80:80 --log-driver=syslog nginx:latest
```
